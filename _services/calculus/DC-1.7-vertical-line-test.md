From our past lesson, we have already learned how to [determine if an equation represents a function or not](https://youtu.be/6z_hPcwd8DQ). 
In this section, let us discuss how to determine if a graph represents a function or not using the Vertical Line Test.

The method is relatively straightforward. If we can draw a vertical line that **intersects the graph more than once**, the graph is considered **NOT A FUNCTION** since a function must only have a single output for every input. Furthermore, the number of intersections of the graph and the vertical line represents the number of outputs the graph has at a specific input.

$\example{1}$
Determine if the given curve represents a function or not.

{% include images.html 
    url= "DC/DC-1.7.2.png" 
    size= "250px"
%}


{% capture include_content %}
Use the Vertical Line Test,

{% include images.html 
    url= "DC/DC-1.7.3.png" 
    size= "250px"
%}

Since the vertical line intersects the graph more than once, it is **NOT A FUNCTION**.

{% endcapture %}
{% include solution.html details = include_content %}

$\example{2}$
Determine if the given curve represents a function or not.

{% include images.html 
    url= "DC/DC-1.7.4.png" 
    size= "250px"
%}



{% capture include_content %}
Use the Vertical Line Test,

{% include images.html 
    url= "DC/DC-1.7.5.png" 
    size= "250px"
%}

Since the vertical line intersects the graph at only one point, it is a **FUNCTION**.

{% endcapture %}
{% include solution.html details = include_content %}

$\example{3}$
Determine if the given curve represents a function or not.

{% include images.html 
    url= "DC/DC-1.7.6.png" 
    size= "250px"
%}


{% capture include_content %}
Use the Vertical Line Test,

{% include images.html 
    url= "DC/DC-1.7.7.png" 
    size= "250px"
%}

Since the vertical line intersects the graph more than once, it is **NOT A FUNCTION**.

{% endcapture %}
{% include solution.html details = include_content %}
