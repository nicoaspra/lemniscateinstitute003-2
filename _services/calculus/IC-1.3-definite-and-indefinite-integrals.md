**Integration** is simply the calculation of an integral. Integrals as a solution to differential functions that have undergone integration can be classified into two, namely the **Definite** and **Indefinite** Integral.

When we refer to the *application of integrals*, it usually pertains to the utilization of **Definite integrals**. Definite integrals result from integrating functions with **defined boundaries** (limits), integrals that result in specific values. However, we will focus on this notion in later chapters of this course.

On the other hand, **Indefinite integrals** *do not contain defined boundaries*; hence, the result of the integration process is a function of the given variable.
