summary: Integral Calculus is a branch of mathematics concerned with the theory and applications of integrals and integration. Some of its applications are determining areas under a curve, volumes of solids of revolution, and lengths of curves. The integral corresponds to summing infinitesimal pieces to describe the continuous region.  In other words, integral calculus is concerned with the process or idea of breaking down into parts to compute the whole. The term part is the infinitesimal piece derived from the concept of differentials. As you may have already noticed, Integral Calculus complements the principles of Differential Calculus.
