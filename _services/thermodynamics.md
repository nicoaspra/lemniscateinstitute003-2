summary: Thermodynamics has been already around for several decades. It specializes in the conversion of energy from one form to another. It also covers the relationship between temperature, heat, work, and energy. It has shown its use in several applications, especially in designing and predicting the performance of powerplants, automobiles, and even refrigerators. This topic is one of the fundamental subjects in engineering, especially for mechanical engineering students, since this specific course builds up a more profound understanding of the conversion of energy, which will be the bedrock of future subjects in the program.
