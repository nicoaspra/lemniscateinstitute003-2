# Overview
In the previous lesson, the concept of voltage and current was introduced and how they play a vital part in a circuit. Another parameter mentioned is the resistance which is the proportionality constant in the relationship between voltage and current in Ohm's Law.
In the following lessons, we will introduce the concept of resistance, conductance, and resistivity and learn to calculate the resistance of various materials under various conditions.



# Lesson Objectives
At the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- define resistance;
- discuss the concept of resistivity;
- discuss the relationship between area, length, and resistance; 
- calculate resistances of given materials; and
- solve for the adjusted resistance of a material as the temperature changes.
