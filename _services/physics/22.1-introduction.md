## Introduction

In the previous lessons, we were introduced to the concept that electricity is a form of energy expressed in terms of, or derived from, the movement and interactions of electrons. 

We also learned that we could quantify electrons through a concept called electrical charge. Though atoms generally have zero net charges, there are cases where an atom **gains or losses an electron** that results in either a positive net charge or negative net charge. 

We can recall that these net charges interact (either attraction or repulsion) with each other obeying Coulomb’s law. Since net force can be achieved between charges, an **electron drift** can be observed.


In the following sections, we will focus our attention on this electron drift and how a closed circuit generates or utilizes electrical energy. But before that, let us recall the fundamental concept of electrical charges.

## *Review:*

- A charge is defined as an electrical property of the atomic particles that consists of matter. 
- A charge is measured in coulombs [C], named after French Engineer and Physicist **Charles-Augustin de Coulomb**.
- 1 **electron** carries a charge of $–1.602 \x 10^{-19} \un{C}$
- 1 **proton** carries a charge of $+1.602 \x 10^{-19} \un{C}$
- To gain **one coulomb of charge**, $6.24 \x 10^{18} \un{electrons}$ must be removed.

<!-- An **electron’s charge** ($e$) is quantified as being equal to $1.602 \x 10^{-19}$ coulombs $(C)$ and has a **negative charge**.  What this means is that every electron intrinsically contains $–1.602 \x 10^{-19} \un{C}$, and it requires $6.24 \x 10^{18} \un{electrons}$ to gain one (1) coulomb of charge.

Similarly, a single **proton** contains $1.602 \x 10^{-19} \un{C}$ in magnitude but **positive in charge**. Hence, one proton contains $+1.602 \x 10^{-19} \un{C}$. 

The presence of equal numbers of protons and electrons in an atom makes it neutrally charged (The algebraic sum of charges is zero). -->
