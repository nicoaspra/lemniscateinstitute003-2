From the [previous section](../2.2-vector-addition-and-subtraction), we already discussed the main difference between a scalar and a vector quantity and had some examples regarding this particular topic. To recall, distance is a scalar quantity, and displacement is a vector. **Distance** refers to "how much ground an object has covered." While **displacement** refers to "how far the object is from its starting position," we could also interpret this as a "change in its position." 

**Distance** is usually represented by the symbol $s$, and the **displacement** by the symbol $\vv{s}$. Furthermore, since the displacement measures the change in position, if $s_i$ is the object's initial position and $s_f$ is the final position, we can denote the displacement as,


{% include tcolorbox.html
    details = "
	\mathrm{displacement}=\Delta\vv{s}=s_f-s_i
    "
%}

Note that the symbol $\Delta$ denotes change, which means "final -- initial."

$\example{1}$
Determine the displacement if $s_1=2$ and $s_2=8$.

{% capture include_content %}
In this example, $s_1$ is the initial position and $s_2$ is the final position. 

{% include images.html 
    url= "phys1/phys1-3.1.1.png" 
    size= "400px"
%}

Hence,

$$
\begin{align*}
	\Delta \vv{s} &= s_f-s_i \\
	&= s_2-s_1 \\
	&= 8-2 \\
	&= 5 \text{ units to the $\tcBal{positive}$ direction}	\tagans
\end{align*}
$$

{% endcapture %}
{% include solution.html details = include_content %}

$\example{2}$
Determine the displacement if $s_1=5$, $s_2=9$, and $s_3=-2$.

{% capture include_content %}
In this example, $s_1$ is the initial position and $s_3$ is the final position.


{% include images.html 
    url= "phys1/phys1-3.1.2.png" 
    size= "500px"
%}

Hence,

$$
\begin{align*}
	\Delta \vv{s} &= s_f-s_i \\
	&= s_3-s_1 \\
	&= -2-5 \\
	&= -7 \text{ units to the $\tcBal{positive}$ direction $\quad$ or} \\
	&= 7  \text{ units to the $\tcBal{negative}$ direction}	\tagans
\end{align*}
$$

$\example{3}$
A dog runs 100 m to the right then 25 m to the left. Determine its displacement.

{% capture include_content %}

{% include images.html 
    url= "phys1/phys1-3.1.3.png" 
    size= "350px"
%}


Since the two given displacements are opposite in direction, we can reverse the direction of one displacement to match the other so that we can add the two.

$$
\begin{align*}
	25 \text{ m to the left} &= -25 \text{ m to the right} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Hence,

$$
\begin{align*}
	\Delta \vv{s} &= 100\un{m}+(-25\un{m}) \\
	&= 75\text{ m to the $\tcBal{right}$}	\tagans
\end{align*}
$$
