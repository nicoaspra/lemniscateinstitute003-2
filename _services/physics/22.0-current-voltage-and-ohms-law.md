# Overview
This lesson presents the basic parameters involved in an electrical circuit. With a strong understanding of the concept of electrical charges and electric field, we can now introduce the more common parameters in an electrical circuit or system, i.e., current and voltage. In this lesson, we will also be introduced to how voltage and currents interact with each other in a circuit, through Ohmâ€™s Law.



# Lesson Objectives
At the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- discuss the concept of current and electromotive force (voltage);
- discuss Ohms Law; and
- solve problems involving the basic electrical parameters.
