As previously established, electron movement is dependent on two conditions: **(a)** an electromotive force (voltage) and **(b)** a closed path. Together with the voltage, the closed path constitutes a **complete electrical circuit**. A physicist named [George Simon Ohm](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Georg-Ohm) found that current is **directly proportional** to the provided voltage in an electric circuit and therefore formulated an equation and what is now known as Ohm's law. 

According to Ohm's law, the voltage $V$ across a resistor is proportional to the current $I$ flowing through it. 

$$V \propto I$$

Ohm defined the resistance, $R$, as the constant of proportionality for a resistor. $R$ is expressed in ohms, which is indicated by the symbol omega [$\ohm$]. Note that resistance will be explored in greater detail in the following lesson; in the meantime, consider it as a parameter that relates voltage and current.

Mathematically, Ohmâ€™s law can be expressed as:

    details = "
        V = IR
    "
%}
$$
\begin{align*}
	\text{Where:}\quad V &= \text{voltage, [V]} & \\
		I &= \text{current, [A]} \\
		R &= \text{resistance, [$\ohm$]}
\end{align*}

$\example{1}$
An electric iron draws 2-A of current. If the iron is known to posses 60 ohms of resistance, find the supplied voltage.

$\given$\\
$$
\begin{align*}
	I &= 2\un{A} & \\
	R &= 60\un{\ohm}
\end{align*}
$$



$\solution$ \\
To solve for the voltage, use the Ohm's Law,

$$
\begin{align*}
	V &= IR \\
	&= (2\un{A})(60\un{\ohm}) \\
	&= 120\un{V}		\tagans
\end{align*}
$$

$\example{2}$
Consider the circuit shown below. Using the Ohm's law, determine the current that will flow in the circuit when the switch is closed.

$\given$\\
$$
\begin{align*}
	V &= 12\un{V} & \\
	R &= 10\un{\ohm}
\end{align*}
$$



$\solution$ \\
Consider the following data from the circuit, to calculate the current $I$, use the Ohm's Law,

$$
\begin{align*}
	V &= IR \\
	I &= \frac{V}{R} \\
	&= \frac{12\un{V}}{10\un{\ohm}} \\
	&= 1.2\un{A}		\tagans
\end{align*}
$$
