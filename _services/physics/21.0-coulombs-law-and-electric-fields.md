# Overview
In the previous lesson, we have introduced the concept of charges, in this lesson, we will expand that concept on how interactions of charges build-up to the concept of electricity as we know it. To accomplish this, we will look into two fundamental concepts: Coulomb’s Law and Electrical Field. By understanding these two notions, we can further understand how a simple concept as electrical charges forms the foundation of electricity and electrical parameters.



# Lesson Objectives
At the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- determine the force between two or more charges suing Coulomb’s Law;
- describe what an electric field is; and
- evaluate problems in electric field.
