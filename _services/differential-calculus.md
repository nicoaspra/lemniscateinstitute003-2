summary: Calculus, has a reputation of being one of the most dreaded subjects in college. The fear and apprehension probably came from the lack of appreciation of the potential of calculus in many applications in and outside of the engineering field. It is our hope that you will learn from the course as well as develop a sense of appreciation for calculus. The succeeding discussions are intended for those with an introductory background in Calculus. Assuming so, you should be able to understand the mathematics involved easily.
